# Welcome to Week 2: "Intro to Machine Learning and Regression"!

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Welcome back friends!

Hopefully week 1 and Benson have made you even more ready to continue your journey into Data Science. The second project is [Project Luther](/projects/02-luther), which will be double the length of Benson at 2 weeks.  Project Luther is an individual project and its main focus will be the following:

* Machine Learning Concepts
* Regression
* Web Scraping: Getting data from the Web
* Selecting and Evaluating a Machine Learning Model
* Feature Selection

#### Technical Focus
The technical lecture content during Project Luther will focus on introductory Machine Learning methods and concepts, specifically in **Supervised Learning**.  In the first week, you'll understand what machine learning is and how it works.  You'll learn techniques for **regression**, predictive modeling techniques that try to estimate a numerical output from a set of attributes about a data observation.  To get your data for Luther you won't just be given a clean data file this time; you'll be extracting it from **HTML** on web pages so you'll need to learn techniques for **Web Scraping** in Python with **`BeautifulSoup`** and **`Selenium`**.  

You'll also be introduced to various techniques for evaluating and improving your models through **Model Evaluation** and **Feature Selection**.  At the end of the week, we'll provide an intro to **Probability** that will set you up for further Machine Learning techniques going forward.
